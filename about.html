		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I have been interested in cosplay since high school and wasn't able to fully get into cosplay until 2011 when I went to my first con, A-Kon. 
		I enjoy making my favorite characters come to life. My favorite thing about cosplay is being recognized as the character I am cosplaying as well 
		as having fun and meeting new friends.</p>
